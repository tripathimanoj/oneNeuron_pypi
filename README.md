## PERCEPTRON >>>

Perceptron(A single neuron neural network) were developed in the 1950s and 1960s by the scientist Frank Rosenblatt, inspired by earlier work by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts.  It is  the initial basic algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

### working of Perceptron >>>

Perceptons takes several inputs x1,x2,x3....xn and produces a single binary output.Then weights were introduced expressing importance of respective inputs to the outputs. The neuron outputs either 0 or 1 ,which is determined by the weighted sum âˆ‘wjxj is less than or greater than threshold value(this is hyperparameter).

Based on the given no of epochs it will try to reduce the error as close to zero by adjusting the weights in every epochs. If the error is constant(can't reduce more) or zero within a given no of epochs those will be the final best weights for each feature. And then it will try to train itself by those final weights and give prediction.
